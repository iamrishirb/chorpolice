        <h2 class="popup-heading">What is Life?</h2>
        <p class="popup-content">This is a really good way to prevent opponents from scoring. It is sort of like 'revive' in a game. If you kill all the life, then the opponent can't score any points & the player session ends.</p>
        <h2 class="popup-heading">What do you mean by Timer?</h2>
        <p class="popup-content">This is a limiting factor for the game. If you don't kill all the life of the opponent, the only thing that stops the opponent from looting is the timer. When the chorr has completed his 7 minutes of session, he can‚Äôt loot anymore. Also each round to play would be of 10 seconds to grab the loot box before the timer runs out.</p>
